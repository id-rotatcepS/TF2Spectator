Links Twitch channel commands to TF2 console commands using the Rcon port.
* Launch
* enter your channel/username ID
* link to twitch (First time it will launch authorization sequence, then save a token for future linking)
* set an Rcon port and password and Launch TF2 (or launch tf2_bot_detector, check its logs, and copy its randomly-generated port and password to share the port with both apps)
* enjoy!

Edit the commands file (!command&lt;tab&gt;console command with {0} substitution from command arg&lt;tab&gt;help text when chat types !help command) to add more stuff.
